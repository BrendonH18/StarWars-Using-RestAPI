# Star Wars with React and Restful API

Second app using the React library that demonstrates knowledge of key React features and makes a Restful API.

## Personal Note

As my second app using React, I used the StarWars API at https://swapi.dev/ to practice asynchronous coding principles and response handling. My major growth moments relate to State and Promises. In addition to asynchronous code, I decided use function-based components whereas my last app used class-based components. The different syntax caused some initial concerns, but I'm glad I stuck with it until the end.

- This app use React to organize and render data acquired through nested API requests.
- Data is shared bidirectionally between React components.
- Future ideas: 
  - Expand the search feature to include more resources (People, films, planets, etc.)
  - Allow the table to dynamically expand columns to accomodate new data.

- This project is a good example of:

FUNCTIONS:
 - API call/response handling
 - Import
 - Lifecycle
   - useEffect()
 - State/Props

CONCEPTS:
- Component Structure
  - Class-Based Components
  - Functional Components
  - Lifecycle Methods
- Event/Submit handling
- Rest/Spread Operator
- Passing props (state and functions) to lower levels
  - Deconstructed props for readability
- Using "state" to update key information
- Referencing an array in "state"
- Using BootStrap 5 to format elements
